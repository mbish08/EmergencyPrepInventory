Emergency Prep Inventory

This is my 3rd project for Flatiron School.  I wrote it during the pandemic when there was a shortage of many supplies (especially toilet paper).  Seeing how many of us were unprepared for an emergency was the inspiration for my concept.  This app can be used to keep track of all of your supplies (every day items and/or emergency supplies) and how they are stored. 

A user is able to view the top three supplies by all users, view their own supplies, add new items, add new storage types, or add supplies that already exist in the database.  Users are able to login with a username/email or with Google authentication. 

This application is written in Ruby on Rails for both the back and front end.  

To use, clone repo from Github and run 'rails s' in your terminal
